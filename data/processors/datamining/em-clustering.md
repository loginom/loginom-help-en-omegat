# ![ ](./../../images/icons/components/em_default.svg) EM Clustering

## Description

EM clustering is based on the scalable [EM algorithm](https://loginom.ru/blog/em) that is supported by assumption that the data set under study can be modelled by means of the linear combination of multidimensional [probability distributions](https://wiki.loginom.ru/articles/normal-distribution.html). The purpose is to assess distribution parameters that maximize logarithmic [likelihood function](https://wiki.loginom.ru/articles/plausibility-function.html) used as the model quality measure. In other words, it is assumed that the data in each cluster is subject to the particular distribution law, namely, probability distribution.

Thus, any observation (object) belongs to all [clusters](https://wiki.loginom.ru/articles/cluster.html) but with different likelihood. The object must relate to the cluster for which this likelihood is higher.

## Ports

### Input

* ![ ](./../../images/icons/app/node/ports/inputs/table_inactive.svg) Input data source (data table).

#### Requirements to the Received Data

The field will be no longer permitted for use in the following cases:

* It is discrete and contains only one unique value.
* It is continuous and with zero variance.
* It contains null values.

### Output

* ![ ](./../../images/icons/app/node/ports/outputs/table_inactive.svg) Clustering (data table).

The table that consists of the following fields:

* **Cluster number**: each object is assigned with the number of the cluster into which it is included.
* **Ownership probability**: it is required to specify probability of ownership by this cluster for each object.
* The source data set fields (values are not changed).

* ![ ](./../../images/icons/app/node/ports/inputs/table_inactive.svg) Cluster centers (data table).

**Cluster center**: the average value of the objects variables included into cluster.
Result is a table the number of records of which complies with the number of clusters, namely, the data is grouped by clusters. It consists of the following fields:

* **Cluster number**: numbers of the generated clusters are listed.
* The source data set fields in the cells of which the average value of parameters has been calculated.

## Wizard

The wizard includes the following groups of parameters:

* Configure input columns.
* Configuration of [normalization](./../normalization).
* EM clustering.

### Configure input columns

* Select fields for clustering:
   * It is required to set *Used* usage types for the fields that are included into clustering.
   * *Unspecified* is preserved for other fields.

### EM Clustering

* Auto selection of clusters. The following pack of parameters becomes available for configuration when selecting the checkbox: *Auto Determination of Clusters Count*.
   * The minimum number of clusters. By default — 1.
   * The maximum number of clusters. By default — 10.
   * Cluster splitting significance threshold (in the interval from 0.1 to 5). The higher splitting significance threshold, the more clusters will be generated while clustering. By default — 1.
* Set number of clusters. The pack of parameters available for configuration in the case of inactive checkbox: *Auto selection of clusters*.
   * Number of clusters. By default — 3.
* Parameters of EM clustering.
   * Variables are independent. Consideration of dependence between variables. If the checkbox is active, there is no dependence.
   * Median modification. Selection of the checkbox means that moment scores of the maximum likelihood at the second M-step of the algorithm are replaced with more stable scores of the median type. It can increase the algorithm stability relative to the source data.

* **Random seed** is a starting seed (integer, positive ) that is used for initialization of pseudo-random number generator. Sequence of generator numbers is fully determined by the starting seed. If the generator is repeatedly initialized with the same starting seed, it will provide the same sequence of numbers.

   The parameter has an impact on the training result reproducibility. It is possible to reproduce the node training result if the same data is provided and the same random seed is set.

   The following commands are available for the parameter:

   * Always randomly: the starting seed will always be random.
   * Generate: the new starting seed will be generated.
   * Copy: the specified value will be copied to the clipboard.
