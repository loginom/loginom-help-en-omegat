# Variables

[Variable](../../workflow/variables/README.md): the named object that can contain only one value of the particular type. There are several kinds of [variables](../../workflow/variables/scenario-variables.md) in Megaladata.

The variables values can be used in calculations, for example, in the following nodes: [Calculator](./../../processors/transformation/calc/README.md),
[Condition](./../../processors/control/condition.md),
etc. The variables values can be also used as
[control variables](./../../workflow/variables/control-variables.md)
to set parameters of the node settings.

There are components designated for work with variables in Megaladata. They are separated into a separate group on the Components panel.
