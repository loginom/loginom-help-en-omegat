# String Functions

## Chr

**Chr(Argument)**

* Argument - numerical code of Unicode character in the range [0, 65535].

Returns Unicode character according to its code.

## Concat

**Concat(String, String [, ... String])**

* String - string expression.

Combines several strings into one.
Null values are interpreted as the strings with zero length, namely, as "".

## Count

**Count(String)**

* String - string expression.

Returns count of characters in the string.

## DamLevDist

**DamLevDist(String1, String2)**

* String1.
* String2 - expressions of the string type.

Function returns the value of the Damerau–Levenshtein distance for String1, String2. The Damerau–Levenshtein distance is also called the edit distance with reference to transpositions that is the similarity of measurement of the two strings. Its result is the minimum number of the character deletion, insertion, substitution and transposition operations that must be performed in order to transform one string into another.

## Find

**Find(Substring, String[, MatchIndex = 1])**

* Substring - searched substring.
* String - the string in which substring is searched.
* MatchIndex - optional occurrence index of the Substring in the String to be returned. Argument of the numeric type.

Function returns position of the first character of the Substring of the set MatchIndex in the String.
The MatchIndex can be both positive and negative. If the MatchIndex is positive, the search is performed from left to right, if it is negative, the search is performed from right to left.
If there is no occurrence of the set order, the function returns 0.
For example, Find("A", "A000A00A", 2) will return position of the second left occurrence of substring "A" to string "A000A00A", namely, 5;
Find("A", "A000A00A", -1) will return position of the first right occurrence of substring "A" to string "A000A00A", namely, 8.
If the MatchIndex is equal to zero, the function will return the Null value (Null).
