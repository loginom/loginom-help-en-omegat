# Normalization of Continuous Data

Let us assume that it is required to cast values to [a, b] range. The following formula is used for this purpose:

$$x^* = \frac{x-x_{min}}{x_{max}-x_{min}}*(b-a)+a$$ ,

where $$x$$ is a current value, $$x_{min}$$, $$x_{max}$$ are minimum and maximum field values. This is how the linear normalizer is used.

### The following data normalization options are available in Loginom:

* **No**: there is no normalization. In this case, the data is sent to the main algorithm without preprocessing.
* **Scaling [min; max]** means the data reduction to [min; max] range set by a user by means of the linear transformation:
   * **Minimum** means the minimum value.
   * **Maximum** means the maximum value.
* **Scaling [-1;1]** means the data reduction to [-1;1] range by means of the linear transformation.
* **Scaling [0;1]** means the data reduction to [0;1] range by means of the linear transformation.
* **Absolute scaling**: each value is divided by the maximum absolute value.
* **Standardization**: the average value is subtracted from each value, and then it is divided by the standard deviation.
* **Quotient**: each value is divided by the statistical indicator or the value set by a user.
   * Divisor:
      * Statistical indicator (Minimum, Maximum, Average, Sum, Standard deviation).
      * Set value.

### Range Control

Control of values range does not let the value go out of the specified range saved while training when executing the node.

* Control method:
   * **No**: there is no control method.
   * **Error**: if the value that goes out of the given range is detected, the following error occurs when the node is started: *Normalizing value exceeds the values range maximum*.
   * **Winsorization**: if the value that goes out of the given range is detected, it is reduced to the maximum/minimum value.
* **Manual setting**: when this checkbox is selected, it becomes possible to select the range of values.
* **Source Range** means the values of the input field minimum and maximum. It is set when retraining the node.
   * Minimum.
   * Maximum.
* **Controlled Range** means the manual setting of values range.
   * Minimum.
   * Maximum.
