# User Roles

The analysis process can be divided into 2 stages, namely, development of the analytical models and review of finished reports.

Development of the analytical models is not a standard task. It is required to understand the analysis methods and peculiarities of business operations. As a rule, a limited number of experienced analysts hold responsibility for this task in companies.

Many employees from different departments must review reports: top managers, heads of departments, specialists of different departments, etc. They must be provided with access to the required results without necessity of thorough understanding of the development process.

For this purpose, it is possible to assign each user with his own role.

The user with the "Workflows design" role is provided with access to all analytical options of Loginom. He can develop the processing logics, create web services, implement and share his own components, connect to the external sources, etc.

The user with "View reports" role is provided with access only to the node with configured reports. He can operate the reports: change their kind, group data, configure filters, change types of charts. However, the calculation logics is not avaliable for him.

The users who are analysts place the required visualizers to the "Reports panel" where both separate preconfigured visualizers and folders with groups of visualizers can be placed. Consequently, the users with "View reports" role are provided with access to the unified node where all preconfigured project reports are kept that makes the system navigation quicker and more comprehensible.
