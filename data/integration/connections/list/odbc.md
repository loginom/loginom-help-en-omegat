# ![ ](../../../images/icons/data-sources/driver-odbc_default.svg) Connection to ODBC

It is used for connection to one of the [ODBC](https://wiki.loginom.ru/articles/odbc.html) data sources.

## Connection Parameters

The following parameters are set during the connection setup:

* **Caption** contains the connection name set by a user.
* **Connection string**: it is required to specify the connection string in the format set in the ODBC driver system, or it is possible to select one of ODBC data sources configured in the system. List of the sources is called by clickong on ![ ](../../../images/extjs-theme/form/open-trigger/open-trigger_default.svg) button. The available ODBC data sources are listed. The sources are configured in [ODBC Windows data sources administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/ru-ru/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/open-the-odbc-data-source-administrator). It also contains information on the drivers installed in the system, and it is possible to define the connection string format.
* **Test connection**: test of the specified connection settings.
* **Login** is a login of the DB user.
* **Password** is a password of the DB user.
* **Save password**: when selecting this flag, login and password will be saved in the current connection settings.
* **Show system tables**: when selecting this flag in the import wizard that uses this connection, the system DB tables available to a user become visible (it is required to select when connecting to the Excel file).
* **Quote names**: if the database objects names (for example, names of tables, fields) contain spaces or reserved characters, it is required to use framing characters fixing the name start and end.
* **Configure quotes** represents the information field that enables to define which framing characters are used for connection to this DB. The framing quotes characters are automatically defined for ODBC.
* **Do not use DBMS client**: this option is not used for ODBC connections.
* **Clear pool when deactivated** enables to clear the pool of the Loginom Integrator packages frequently used in the batch processing saved for quick call upon the node deactivation. This parameter is disabled by default.
* **Description**: it is possible to provide any reference data concerning connection in this form.

> **Note:** To provide connection, it is required to install ODBC driver with the same bitness as the Loginom application/server bitness. Two ODBC data sources administrators are used in 64 bit OS - 32 bit C:\Windows\SysWOW64\odbcad32.exe and 64 bit C:\Windows\System32\odbcad32.exe.
