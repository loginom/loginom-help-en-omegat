# ![ ](../../../images/icons/data-sources/db-clickhouse_default.svg) ClickHouse Connection

It is used for connection to the ClickHouse database.

## Connection Parameters

The following parameters are set during the connection setup:

* **Caption** contains the connection name set by a user.
* **Connection string** represents the string of the following kind: `host[:port][:database]`. It is set in a separate window that can be called both by clicking on ![ ](../../../images/extjs-theme/form/open-trigger/open-trigger_default.svg) button, and by entering the parameters manually. *Port* and *database* parameters are optional. By default, *port* `9000`, `default` *database*.
* **Test connection**: test of the specified connection settings.
* **Login** is a login of the DB user. By default `default`.
* **Password** is a password of the DB user. The password is not available by default.
* **SSL settings**: ![ ](../../../images/extjs-theme/form/open-trigger/open-trigger_default.svg) button enables to call the dialog of connection parameters setup via secure connection:
   * **Use SSL**: when this flag is selected, the data is transferred via cryptographic SSL/TLS protocol.
   * **CA certificate** is a path to the file with the root certificate.
   * **User certificate** is a path to the file with the client certificate.
   * **Private key** is a path to the file with the private key.
   * **Private key password** is a private key password. It is null be default.
* **Use local time zone** ptovides conversion from the local time to UTC and vice versa for the columns of [DateTime](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/ru/sql_reference/data_types/datetime/) type. This option is enabled by default.
* **Compression method**: `Without compression` (it is used by default) and `LZ4` options are available.
* **Show system tables**: when selecting this flag in the import wizard that uses this connection, the system DB tables available to a user become visible.
* **Quote names**: if the database objects names (for example, names of tables, fields) contain spaces or reserved characters, it is required to use framing characters fixing the name start and end.
* **Configure quotes** represents the information field that enables to define which framing characters are used for connection to this DB. Double quotes are used for ClickHouse.
* **Do not use DBMS client** is not available as the inbox driver is always used to connect to ClickHouse.

> **Note:**
> * Connection pool is not used.
> * When [exporting data to the new table](../../export/database/new-table-design.md), the table of [Log engine](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/ru/engines/table_engines/log_family/log/) is created.
> * In connection with the ClickHouse DB restrictions:
>    * Transactions are not supported.
>    * Dates from1970 to 2106 are supported.
>    * Update of the current records in the table is not supported.
>    * Deletion by key is available only for the tables with the [MergeTree](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/ru/engines/table_engines/#mergetree) engines.

> **Important:** Data mutation operations are not atomic in the MergeTree tables (for more details, see [Mutations](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/ru/sql_reference/statements/alter/#alter-mutations)). As mutations are used during the export operation with deletion by key, the export node activation does not provide termination of the records deletion process. Duration of the mutation performed by a user is not controlled. Thus, request for data sampling set just after execution of the export node with deletion by key can return the old records.
> It is required to take this feature of the ClickHouse DB into account when designing systems.
