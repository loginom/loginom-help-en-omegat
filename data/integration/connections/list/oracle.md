# ![ ](../../../images/icons/data-sources/db-oracle_default.svg) Connection to Oracle

It is used for connection to the Oracle database.

It is possible to provide connection both via DBMS client, and Loginom internal driver.

## Connection Parameters

The following parameters are set during the connection setup:

* **Caption** contains the connection name set by a user.
* **Connection string** is a string used by the driver for connection to the required database. The string connection format is defined by the used driver (refer to *Do not use DBMS client* parameter).
   * The string format when the inbox driver is used is as follows: **`<ServerName>:<Port>:<Instance>`**.
      * **ServerName**: the DBMS server host.
      * **Port** means the TCP port used by the DBMS server to provide interaction with the client.
      * **Instance** means Oracle Database Instance (SID) that contains the required data.
   * The string format when DBMS client is used is as follows: *`<ServerName>`*.
      * **ServerName**: the DBMS server host as stated in tnsnames.ora configuration file of Oracle server.
* **Test connection**: test of the specified connection settings.
* **Login** is a login of the DB user.
* **Password** is a password of the DB user.
* **Save password**: when selecting this flag, login and password will be saved in the current connection settings.
* **Show system tables**: when selecting this flag in the import wizard that uses this connection, the system DB tables available to a user become visible.
* **Quote names**: if the database objects names (for example, names of tables, fields) contain spaces or reserved characters, it is required to use framing characters fixing the name start and end.
* **Configure quotes** represents the information field that enables to define which framing characters are used for connection to this DB. Double quotes are used for Oracle.
* **Do not use DBMS client**: if this option is used, the alternative inbox driver built into the platform is used for connection to DBMS.
* **Clear pool when deactivated** enables to clear the pool of the Loginom Integrator packages frequently used in the batch processing saved for quick call upon the node deactivation. This parameter is disabled by default.
* **Description**: it is possible to provide any reference data concerning connection in this form.

> **Note:** To provide connection to the database via DBMS client, it is required to install the client library files (DLL) with the same bitness as the Loginom application/server bitness.
