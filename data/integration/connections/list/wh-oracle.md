# ![wh-oracle](../../../images/icons/data-sources/wh-oracle_default.svg) Connection to Deductor Warehouse [Oracle]

It is used for connection to the [Deductor Warehouse](../../../data-format/data-warehouse.md) Data Warehouse based on Oracle DBMS.

It is possible to provide connection both via DBMS client, and Loginom internal driver.

## Connection Parameters

The following parameters are set during the connection setup:

* **Caption** contains the connection name set by a user.
* **Connection string** is a string used by the driver for connection to the required database. The string connection format is defined by the used driver (refer to *Do not use DBMS client* parameter below):
   * The string format when DBMS client is used is as follows:
      * **`<ServerName>`** where
         **ServerName**: the DBMS server host as stated in tnsnames.ora configuration file of Oracle server.
   * The string format when the inbox driver is used can relate to the following kind:
      * **`<ServerName>:<Port>:<SID>`** or
      * **`<ServerName>[:<Port>]/<Service_name>`** where:
         * **ServerName**: the DBMS server host.
         * **Port** means the TCP port used by the DBMS server to provide interaction with the client.
         * **SID** is a unique name of the DB example (System ID).
         * **ServiceName** means the alias of one or several DB examples.
* **Test connection**: connectivity test with the specified settings.
* **Login** is a login of the DB user.
* **Password** is a password of the DB user.
* **Parameters**:
   * **Save password**: when selecting this flag, login and password will be saved in the current connection settings.
   * **Show system tables**: when selecting this flag in the import wizard that uses this connection, the system DB tables available to a user become visible.
   * **Quote names**: if the database objects names (for example, names of tables, fields) contain spaces or reserved characters, it is required to use framing characters fixing the name start and end.
   * **Configure quotes** represents the information field that enables to define which framing characters are used for connection to this DB. Double quotes are used for Oracle.
   * **Do not use DBMS client**: if this option is used, the alternative inbox driver built into the platform is used for connection to DBMS.
   * **Clear pool when deactivated** enables to clear the pool of the Loginom Integrator packages frequently used in the batch processing saved for quick call upon the node deactivation. This parameter is disabled by default.
* **Description**: it is possible to provide any reference data concerning connection in this field.

> **Note:** If DBMS client is used, it must be with the same bitness as the Loginom application/server bitness.

## Compatibility

Starting from Oracle Database 9i and higher.

> **Important:** UTF16 encoding is used for data exchange with the server.
