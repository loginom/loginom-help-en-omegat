# ,![ ](../../images/icons/data-sources/db-database-export_default.svg) Export to Database

The handler exports the initial data set to database.

> **Important:** For the node operation, it is required to pre-create [connection](../connections/README.md) to database and connect it with the *Connection* input port. [Example of the DB connection and operation](../../quick-start/database.md).

### Input

* ![ ](../../images/icons/app/node/ports/inputs/link_inactive.svg) Connection is a port for connection to database.
* ![ ](../../images/icons/app/node/ports/inputs/table_inactive.svg) Data source is a data table to be exported to database.
* ![ ](../../images/icons/app/node/ports/inputs-optional/variable_inactive.svg) [Control variables](../../scenario/variables/control-variables.md) (optional port): it is possible to set values of wizard parameters using variables.

## Wizard

* **Database** enables to display a string of connection to database. The *Activate* button makes this connection active.
* **Table name** enables to set a name of the table to which it is planned to export data. This table can be selected from the list of the database tables. [*Create table*](./database/new-table-design.md) button enables to open the window of the new table creation in DB.
* **Export type** enables to select one of the variants.
   * **Append data to table** enables to append rows from the source table to the selected database table.
   * **Clear table and fill in data** enables to clear the database table completely and fill in with rows of the exported table.
   * **Delete records by key fields** enables to select a key field by which records will be deleted from the database table at the next stage - *Adjustment of Columns Mapping*. In this case, export as such is not performed.
   * **Delete records by key fields and insert data into table** provides the same algorithm as for the previous parameter but rows from the source table will be appended to the database table upon its execution.
   * **Update existing table records** enables to select a key field by which records will be updated.
* **Transaction commit frequency (rows)** enables to divide the export process into several transactions. Transactions are committed after a given number of rows. If the parameter value is null, division into transactions is not performed.
