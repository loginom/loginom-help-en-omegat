1. [Main menu](./main-menu.md) enables user to start/complete the work, gain access to packages and platform settings, etc.
   Composition of the *Main menu* elements can be changed according to the platform edition (Server/Desktop), user rights, and also when using visualizers.
2. [Address bar](./address-bar.md): the line that contains a path to the opened object.
3. Working space: the area in which the main actions related to workflow construction, configuration of connections, reports, platform administration, etc. are performed. Composition of elements, available commands and visual display of this area depend on the platform page that is in active state. Working space of ["Workflow"](./workflow.md) page is shown on Figure 1.
4. ["Processes" panel](./processes-panel.md): the panel that contains detailed information on processing of data by the Workflow nodes.
