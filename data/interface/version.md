# How to Define Loginom Version

## Personal editions (Community, Personal)

### By interface tools

1. It is required to click the Menu icon in the left upper corner upon Loginom start, and then you are to click the "About" menu option. The new window with the version information will be opened (for example, Loginom X.X.X where X.X.X  is a version number).

### By OS tools

1. It is required to hover a cursor over the required application in Windows Explorer (in this case: C:\Program Files\BaseGroup\Loginom 6\Personal\Embedded.exe). The appeared window contains information on the application, including version number (for example, file version: X.X.X.Y where X.X.X  is a version number, and Y is a build number).

2. It is required to open the Application Properties using any available method (in this case, C:\Program Files\BaseGroup\Loginom 6\Personal\Embedded.exe). Read more tab contains information on the application (for example, application version X.X.X where X.X.X  is a version number; file version: X.X.X.Y - refer to the information above).

3. It is required to open Control panel, and select Program uninstallation. The last Version column contains information on the version number (for example, X.X.X or X.X.X.Y where X.X.X  is a version number, and Y is a build number).

## Server editions (Team, Standard, Enterprise)

### By interface tools

1. It is required to open the Loginom home page. There is a version number in the left lower corner before login/password entering (for example, Loginom X.X.X where X.X.X  is a version number).

2. It is required to click the Menu icon in the left upper corner after Loginom authorization, and then you are to click "About". The new window with the version information will be opened (for example, Loginom X.X.X where X.X.X  is a version number).

### By OS tools

1. Methods to view the version number on the Loginom server using the OS tools are similar to the methods that are described above for desktop editions. But a user should have administrator rights to get remote access to the Loginom server file system. The Loginom application of interest is a server (C:\Program Files\BaseGroup\Loginom 6\Server\Server.exe).
