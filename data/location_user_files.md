# ![](./images/icons/system_object_18/filestorage_default.svg) File Storage

All user files are kept on the Loginom server in the Enterprise, Standard and Team editions (the Loginom server is included into the supply package). Thus, before any file is used in the workflow, it is preliminarily placed into the file storage on the server. File manager is used for the file storage operation in these editions.

> **Note:** When using the Personal and Community editions, the file manager is not available as these program versions are designated for the personal processing but a user has access to the whole file space of the local computer.

When using the Loginom server, each user has his own folder in the file storage. Physically, the following path is used for location of all user folders on the server: `"C:\ProgramData\BaseGroup\Loginom 6\UserStorage"`. This path can be changed in the configuration files of the Loginom server. Apart from access to the personal folder, a user can be provided with access rights to other file storage folders by the server administrator.

The personal user folder and his account (login) have the same name.

The path to the file or package in the file storage is set relative to the UserStorage folder. For example:

* full path to the package: `"C:\ProgramData\BaseGroup\Loginom 6\UserStorage\<user>\test.lgp"` where `<user>` is a user login;
* path to the package in the file storage: `<user>/test.lgp`.

The file manager is called using ![](./images/icons/system_toolbar_48x48/filestorage_default.svg) button of the *Main Menu*. This tool is required for the file storage operation.

The hierarchic structure of the folders and files available to a user is displayed in the file manager interface. The double cursor click on the folder is used to move inside this folder. To move to the folder one level up, it is required to double click ![](./images/icons/main-menu/open-folder_default.svg)**..** button. To move between folders, it is also possible to use the *Navigation* panel in which the user folders hierarchy is displayed.
