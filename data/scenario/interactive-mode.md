# Interactive Mode of Operation

**Interactive mode of operation** means the mode when design, start of nodes and debugging of workflows are performed in the [interface](../interface/README.md) of Loginom Studio.

The interactive mode of operation is used in the platform working space (refer to Figure 1).

The workflow is designed in the special zone, namely, in the workflow construction area that is located to the right.

The nodes are based on the components the panel of which is located in the left part of the program window. To make the node from the component, it must be moved to the working space using the button or context menu.

It is possible to create the Workflow by placing several nodes into the working space and connecting them with each other. The Workflow is started by the sequential (each node is separately activated) or simultaneous activation of nodes.

The Workflow is corrected by the standard operations with nodes (configuration, adding, deletion) and impact on their sequential links.
