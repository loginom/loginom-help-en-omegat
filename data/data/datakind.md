# Data Kind (Continuous, Discrete)

**Discrete data** means the data the number of which is finite or infinite but it can be calculated using the natural numbers from one ad infinitum. All string or logical data is discrete. The numeric data can be also discrete, for example, "Article code" that takes the integer value is discrete as arithmetic operations with this indicator are meaningless.

**Continuous data** means the data that can take any values in some interval. Continuous values are appropriate in arithmetic operations and they have meaning. There are the following examples of the continuous data: height, weight, quantity of goods, profit, etc.

The table below shows the data kind that can be used for each data type.
