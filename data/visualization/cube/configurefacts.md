# ![Configure Measures](../../images/icons/cube/cases/case-tune_default.svg) Configure Measures

It enables to configure the displayed measures by selecting checkboxes for the required measures/options of [aggregation](../../processors/func/aggregation-functions.md) and methods of their display.

It is possible to perform the required successive operations with several measures in *Configure measures* window. Changes will be introduced into the *Cube* upon pressing *Apply* button.

> **Note:** ![Count-Measure](../../images/icons/data-types/none_default.svg)*Count* measure is available in the list. It is available even when none of the source data set field is used as a measure. The only aggregation option is available for it: ![Count-Aggregation](../../images/icons/aggregations/factor-count_default.svg)*Count*. It shows the count of the source data set records included into the cube cell.

## Operations

* ![](../../images/icons/toolbar-controls/moveup_default.svg) **Move up** enables to move the measure/aggregation option/representation method one item position up.
* ![](../../images/icons/toolbar-controls/movedown_default.svg) **Move down** enables to move the measure/aggregation option/representation method one item position down.
* ![](../../images/icons/toolbar-controls/collapce-all_default.svg) **Collapse tree**: collapse the tree of measures.
* ![](../../images/icons/toolbar-controls/open-all_default.svg) **Expand tree**: expand the tree of measures.
* ![](../../images/icons/toolbar-controls/check-all_default.svg) **Check all**: check all measures, options of aggregation with all representation methods.
* ![](../../images/icons/toolbar-controls/uncheck-all_default.svg) **Uncheck all**: uncheck all measures, aggregation options with all representation methods.
* ![](../../images/icons/toolbar-controls_18x18/toolbar-controls_18x18_plus_default.svg) **Add measure...**: open the window to [add measure](./addfact.md) to cube.
* ![](../../images/icons/cube/cases/case-calc_default.svg) **Add calculated measure…**: open the window to add the [calculated measure](./addcalculatingfact.md) to cube.
* ![](../../images/icons/toolbar-controls/edit_default.svg) **Edit calculated measure…**: open the window to edit the calculated measure.
* ![](../../images/icons/toolbar-controls/delete_default.svg) **Delete measure**: delete the selected measure.

> **Note:** Upon ![](../../images/icons/toolbar-controls_18x18/toolbar-controls_18x18_plus_default.svg) Add measure..., ![](../../images/icons/cube/cases/case-calc_default.svg) Add calculated measure… or ![](../../images/icons/toolbar-controls/delete_default.svg) Delete measure operations, *Cancel* button in *Configure measures* window will become unavailable. It is possible to cancel any operation by performing the one that is the inverse one. In the  *Кубе* only the measures selected in *Configure measures* window at the moment of *Apply* button pressing will be displayed.

* ![](../../images/icons/cube/aggregation/row-percent_default.svg) **Percent by row** enables to display the rate in percentage terms taken by this measure in this row.
* ![](../../images/icons/cube/aggregation/col-percent_default.svg) **Percent by column** enables to display the rate in percentage terms taken by this measure in this column.
