# Notes

Notes are always added to the workflow field. They are independent blocks that are not connected with nodes or other elements. They are always located under nodes and links. They can be cut, copied, pasted, collapsed and expanded in the framework of supernodes.

There is a set of preinstalled color styles and stroke kinds available for notes. The note styles menu is opened by right-clicking the note.

Text inside the notes is carried over to the new line with word break even in the middle of the word. If there is no enough space for the text in the note, it is possible to add scrolling (only the vertical one). Successive spaces are collapsed into one when displaying the note.
