# Interactive Mode of Operation

**Interactive mode of operation** means the mode when design, start of nodes and debugging of the *Workflow* are performed in the Megaladata Studio [interface](./../interface/README.md).

The interactive mode of operation is performed on "Workflow" page (refer to Figure 1).

The *Workflow* is designed in the special zone, namely, in the workflow construction area that is located to the right.

The nodes are based on the *Components* the panel of which is located in the left part of the window. To make the node from the component, it is required to move it to the workflow construction area using the mouse or context menu.

It is possible to create the *Workflow* by placing several nodes into the workflow construction area and connecting them with each other. The workflow is started by the sequential (each node is separately activated) or simultaneous activation of nodes.

The *Workflow* is corrected by the standard operations with nodes (configuration, adding, deletion) and impact on their sequential links.
